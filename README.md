# PXSpriteEngine

The goal is to create a very simple 2d sprite engine. Basically, just the features needed to create a decent platformer.

Much of the code was originally from this article, however most of the code taken from here has been substantially modified at this point:

The project is broken into several files, according to the role their code plays. The index.html file links to those files, and also contains additional code as an example of how to use them.

This project is in the early stages. Significant updates are in development.
